# Data Engineering Challenge ðŸš€

Hey there! Welcome to the Data Engineering Project â€“ where weâ€™re diving into Docker, Python, the Open-Meteo API, and some fascinating data adventures! Take a moment to check out the instructions, and then letâ€™s get cracking. Youâ€™ve got this!

## What You Need

### Git

No Git yet? No problem! Grab it here and youâ€™re good to go: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Docker Desktop

For this challenge, youâ€™ll need Docker Desktop. You can snag it here: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

#### For Windows Users: WSL2 is a Must

Using Windows? Make sure WSL2 is installed. Donâ€™t worry, hereâ€™s a handy guide: [WSL2 Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/)

### VSCode

Weâ€™ll be working in a predefined Docker container as our development environment. Itâ€™s already packed with some nifty tools to help you out. All you need is VSCode! If youâ€™re rocking another IDE that supports Docker containers, that works too.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/marius-ha/data-engineering-challenge.git
    cd data-engineering-challenge
    ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code â€“ the devcontainer will take care of the setup for you!

3. If anything is missing, just install it using `pip`. Easy peasy.

## What Weâ€™re Doing

Weâ€™ve lined up some cool tasks for you to tackle:

1. **Check the Weather with the Open-Meteo API:**
    - Fetch [weather data](https://open-meteo.com/) using the Open-Meteo API.
    - Use Pythonâ€™s `request` library.
    - Explore historical weather data (hourly) for **Essen**. Weâ€™re curious about:
        - Temperature
        - Relative Humidity
        - Rain
        - Weather Code
        - Wind Speed
        - Surface Pressure
    - Create clear and helpful logging for successes and errors. Itâ€™ll save you headaches and impress users. ðŸ˜Ž
    - Show off your API mastery and data extraction skills.

2. **Load Data into DuckDB:**
    - Load the data into a local [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).
    - Add some spice by deciding the loading strategy at startup:
        - **Full-Refresh:** Wipe everything and reload the data warehouse from scratch.
        - **Incremental:** Only add new data to the data warehouse.
    - Check the API response and figure out how best to structure the data for DuckDB.

3. **Control the Python Script:**
    - Make the following API call parameters adjustable via the command line:
        - Latitude
        - Longitude
        - Start Date
        - End Date
        - Timezone

4. **Docker Container:**
    - Wrap your Python app in a Docker container.
    - By the end, we want to see your container running, accepting API parameters, and displaying logging output right in the console. Simple and sleek.

5. **...and Beyond:**
    - Keep your code clean, readable, and well-commented. Bonus points for style!
    - Use functions and classes where they make sense.
    - Version control your work with `git`, and when youâ€™re ready, push it back to the repository so we can take a look. We canâ€™t wait to see your magic!

## Letâ€™s Code!

Youâ€™ve got this! Have fun and enjoy the ride. If you hit any bumps along the way, weâ€™re here to help. Go on, show us what youâ€™ve got! ðŸš€âœ¨
